# go-amizone
**go-amizone** is a simple Go library and API client for the [Amizone](https://s.amizone.net) student portal.
This library is intended to be used as a self-hosted Go API or as an SDK in your Go application.

## Inspiration
Amizone is _the_ student portal for [Amity University](https://www.amity.edu/). It's indispensable
for students to access their grades, attendance, class schedule and other information. The 
catch: it's buggy, slow and goes down now and then. Consequentially, students have made a slew
of alternative apps and tools to access Amizone -- many of them mobile apps, but also
arguably better approaches like the excellent [monday-api][monday-api] bot by [@0xSaurabh][0xSaurabh],
which inspired me to work on this library.

**So why yet another tool?** Because I wanted a simple, easy-to-use and robust API client for Amizone and there was none.
There is no standard API-abstraction library for Amizone, so every tool has its own reverse-engineered way
of getting data from Amizone, some more complete than others, some more broken than others.
